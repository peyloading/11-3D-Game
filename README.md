11-3D-Game

This is my 3D game for C220 Game Technology. In this game, you are set out in a small maze of a house to find blue flowers and 
push them to the grassy area you discover in the maze. You take the form of a mouse, and this is why all the walls are super
tall. 
You start the game in the house's vent system, and then fall down into the main area. The game starts from there and you 
work your way around and push the flowers around. 

I changed the way my game works a lot, going from a maze-like FPS to a coin grab game, to this newest version. I thought the 
physics of the flower models were really fun whenever my character bumped into them, so I came up with this idea.

Hope you enjoy even if it isn't the most complex!
